    <h1>PiSeeker Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 8, 2025</p>
    <p>PiSeeker is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how PiSeeker collects, uses, and protects your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Microphone and Speech Data:</strong> In Recite mode, PiSeeker uses your device’s microphone and Apple’s speech recognition service to process spoken digits, with your consent via iOS permissions. This data is used solely to compare your spoken digits to Pi’s digits and is processed on-device or by Apple’s servers (subject to Apple’s privacy policies).</li>
        <li><strong>Local Statistics:</strong> PiSeeker stores game statistics (e.g., best score, last offset) locally on your device using SwiftData. This data is not shared or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, ID).</p>
    
    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Microphone/speech data is used to enable Recite mode functionality.</li>
        <li>Local statistics are used to display your best score in the app.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>PiSeeker does not share your data with third parties. No third-party analytics, advertising, or SDKs are used.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Microphone/speech data is not stored by PiSeeker beyond the session. Apple’s speech recognition service may retain data per their privacy policy.</li>
        <li>Local statistics remain on your device until you delete the app, which removes all data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Revoking Consent</h2>
    <p>You can revoke microphone or speech recognition permissions at any time via Settings > Privacy > Microphone or Speech Recognition on your device. This will disable Recite mode but not affect other features.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Local data is protected by your device’s security features. No data is transmitted off-device by PiSeeker.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions about this policy, contact <a href="mailto:athayes@gmail.com">athayes@gmail.com</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. Updates will be posted here and effective upon posting.</p>
